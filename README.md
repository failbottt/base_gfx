### What is this?

This is my base programming layer.

The idea is to create my own:

- GUI framework
- Font renderer
- Graphics renderer
- Helpers
- etc...

That I can use as the starting point for upcoming hobby projects.

Right now it's Windows only, but the idea would be to have it run on linux (at least) as well.

I don't have grand plans. It's all for fun, learning, and creating my own toolset such that I can learn how to program these things for myself. I don't have anything against frameworks - I use them all the time - tbut I want to know how to build it myself.

### Credits

I've been heavily influenced by these folks. So a big thanks to them.
